	\begin{definition}[Big-O]
		$f(n) = O(g(n))$ if there exists a positive constant $c$ and an integer
		$n_0$ such that $f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Big-$\Omega$]
		$f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ if there exists a positive constant $c$ and an
		integer $n_0$ such that $c \cdot g(n) \leq f(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Big-$\Theta$]
		$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$ if there exists positive constants $c_1$, $c_2$,
		and an integer $n_0$ such that $c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot
		g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

	\noindent \textbf{HW3 - Ex.4} Like in many previous exercises and homeworks,
	find tight asymptotic bounds (big-Theta) for $T(n)$ in each of the cases.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $T(n)=2T(n/4)+n^2\sqrt n$
		\item $T(n)=T(n-1)+\frac1n$
		\item $T(n)=1600T(n/4)+n!$ (hint: answering this shouldn't require too
			many, if any, difficult calculations) 
		\item $T(n)=6T(n/3)+n^4/\log^{25} n$ (hint: answering this shouldn't
			require too many, if any, difficult calculations)
		\item  $T(n)=\sqrt n T(\sqrt{n}) + n$ (hint: when everything fails, you
			guess and check)
		\item $T(n)=T(n/2)+n(5-\cos^2n\sin^{20}n)$ (hint: answering this shouldn't
			require too many, if any, difficult calculations, just think the most
			basic trigonometric inequality)
		\item $T(n)=\alpha T(n/4)+n^2$ (hint: your answer should depend on the
			$\alpha$ parameter)
		\item $T(n)=5T(n/5) +\frac{n}{\log_5 n}$ (hint: think of $n=5^m$. Also the
			recursion $T(n)=T(n-1)+\frac1n$ above may come in handy.)
